# FAQ Component

With `MDX`, we can define a story for `FAQ` right in the middle of our
Markdown documentation.

## Story

<Canvas>
  <Story 
    name="Sample FAQ"
    args={{
      items: [
        {
            "question": "How much duty and tax will I have to pay?",
            "answer": `You will not be required to pay any import taxes or duties.
 
For any further queries, please [Contact Us](#).`
        },
        {
            "question": "How can I personalise my item?",
            "answer": `If the option to personalise is available it will be displayed on the product page for the item. You can select and preview your chosen characters and/or symbols for each product before adding it to your basket.
 
Please note: up to three characters and/or symbols can be personalised. Symbols are not available for all products.`
        }
      ],
      header: "Sample FAQ"
    }}>
      {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props
